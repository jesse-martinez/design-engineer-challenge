# E&N Design Engineer Challenge

### [Figma design & instructions](https://www.figma.com/design/kT2HOZLLowfbBNKKcvNdsb/Design-Engineer-Challenge-'24?node-id=74-1006&t=ExpnE1yl3BivMAvX-1)

1. [Duplicate this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) to your own GitHub account (you can make it private; if so please give access to `benface` and `0xa3k5`).
2. Clone the new repo to your local machine.
3. Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies, then `pnpm dev` to start the dev server at `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Start working on the challenge (hint: you probably want to start in `src/app/page.tsx`). Take the time you need to reproduce the design and add any delight you deem necessary, but we don't expect you to spend more than 2 hours on it.
5. When you're done, push your changes to your repo and send us the link.
